# Applicant-Manager

An job applicant manager that allows Salesforce community users (CU) to apply for a
position, allows for CUs to submit tickets if there is an issue,
and allows for tracking the status of one's application. 

On the flip side, internal HR employees can monitor applications, comment, set
recommended salary, and submit a user for approval to the HR manager. The HR manager can choose to reject or deny the CU's application. The CU will get emails on submission and on acceptance. 

HR managers and employees will get warning messages if a CU's application is
not approved or rejected within two business days.
